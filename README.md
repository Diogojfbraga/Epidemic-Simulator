# Epidemic Simulator

## Overview

The Epidemic Simulator is a JavaScript application that simulates the spread of an outbreak based on various social distancing parameters. Inspired by a Washington Post article, this simulator allows users to explore how different factors influence the transmission of a virus within a population.

## Features

- **Population Dynamics:** Simulate outbreaks with customizable population size.
- **Social Distancing:** Explore the impact of social distancing by adjusting the parameter from 0% (no social distancing) to 100% (complete social distancing).
- **Visual Representation:** The simulation provides a visual representation of healthy, sick, recovered, and deceased individuals over time.
- **Configurable Variables:** Easily modify parameters such as recovery time, death chance, and person size.

## How to Use

1. **Adjust Parameters:** Play around with population size, social distancing, and other variables.
2. **Run Simulation:** Run the simulation to observe the spread of the outbreak.
3. **Visual Insights:** Analyze the visual representation to understand the impact of different parameters.

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by the Washington Post's Coronavirus Simulator and is a learning exercise in JavaScript programming. The code is well-documented, making it accessible for those interested in studying or modifying the simulation.

## How to Run

1. **Download:** Clone the repository and download the required sound files.
2. **Setup Environment:** Set up a local environment with the necessary tools for running JavaScript applications.
3. **Open HTML:** Open the HTML file in a web browser to run the simulation.

Feel free to explore, experiment, and enjoy simulating epidemic scenarios!
